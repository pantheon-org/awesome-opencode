# Documentation Directory

This directory contains detailed documentation for each tool in the Awesome OpenCode list.

Each tool is documented in a markdown file within its category subdirectory:

```
docs/
├── ai-coding-assistants/
├── code-analysis-quality/
├── development-automation/
├── documentation-tools/
├── testing-tools/
└── ide-extensions/
```

## Automated Generation

Tool documentation is automatically generated when a new tool is submitted via GitHub issues.
